lab 9 - blog post using mongodb

EXPLANATION IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK.
 
I've been having troubles with mongodb, I can't seem to connect it. I used it for my Adv. Data Base class and since then it stopped working :( . So I can't verify my program works. I been trying to fix it, but I haven't been able.
